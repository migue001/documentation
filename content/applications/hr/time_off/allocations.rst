Allocations
===========

Once :ref:`time off types <time_off/time-off-types>` and :ref:`accrual plans
<time_off/accrual-plans>` have been configured, the next step is to *allocate*, or give, time off to
employees.

The *Allocations* section of the *Time Off* app is **only** visible to users who have either
:guilabel:`Time Off Officer` or :guilabel:`Administrator` access rights for the *Time Off*
application. For more information on access rights, refer to the :doc:`access rights
<../../general/users/access_rights/>` documentation.

Allocate time off
=================

To create a new allocation, navigate to :menuselection:`Time Off app --> Management -->
Allocations`.

This presents a list of all current allocations, including their respective statuses.

Click :guilabel:`New` to allocate time off, and a blank allocation form appears.

After entering a name for the allocation on the first blank field of the form, enter the following
information:

- :guilabel:`Time Off Type`: using the drop-down menu, select the type of time off that is being
  allocated to the employees.
- :guilabel:`Allocation Type`: select either :guilabel:`Regular Allocation` or :guilabel:`Accrual
  Allocation`. If the allocation is **not** based on an :ref:`accrual plan
  <time_off/accrual-plans>`, select :guilabel:`Regular Allocation`.
- :guilabel:`Accrual Plan`: if :guilabel:`Accrual Allocation` is selected for the
  :guilabel:`Allocation Type`, the :guilabel:`Accrual Plan` field appears. Using the drop-down menu,
  select the accrual plan with which the allocation is associated. An accrual plan **must** be
  selected for an :guilabel:`Accrual Allocation`.
- :guilabel:`Validity Period/Start Date`: if :guilabel:`Regular Allocation` is selected for the
  :guilabel:`Allocation Type`, this field is labeled :guilabel:`Validity Period`. If
  :guilabel:`Accrual Allocation` is selected for the :guilabel:`Allocation Type`, this field is
  labeled :guilabel:`Start Date`.

  The current date populates the first date field by default. To select another date, click on the
  pre-populated date to reveal a popover calendar window. Navigate to the desired start date for the
  allocation, and click on the date to select it.

  If the allocation expires, select the expiration date in the next date field. If the time off does
  *not* expire, leave the second date field blank. `No Limit` appears in the field if no date is
  selected.

  If :guilabel:`Accrual Allocation` is selected for the :guilabel:`Allocation Type`, this second
  field is labeled :guilabel:`Run until`.
- :guilabel:`Allocation`: enter the amount of time that is being allocated to the employees. This
  field displays the time in either :guilabel:`Hours` or :guilabel:`Days`, depending on how the
  selected :ref:`Time Off Type <time_off/time-off-types>` is configured (in hours or days).
- :guilabel:`Mode`: using the drop-down menu, select how the allocation is assigned. This selection
  determines who receives the time off allocation. The options are :guilabel:`By Employee`,
  :guilabel:`By Company`, :guilabel:`By Department`, or :guilabel:`By Employee Tag`.

  Depending on what is selected for the :guilabel:`Mode`, this following field is labeled either:
  :guilabel:`Employees`, :guilabel:`Company`, :guilabel:`Department`, or :guilabel:`Employee Tag`.

  Using the drop-down menu, indicate the specific employees, company, department, or employee tags
  who are receiving this time off.

  Multiple selections can be made for either :guilabel:`Employees` or :guilabel:`Employee Tag`.

  Only one selection can be made for the :guilabel:`Company` or :guilabel:`Department`.
- :guilabel:`Add a reason...`: if any description or note is necessary to explain the time off
  allocation, enter it in this field at the bottom of the form.

Request allocation
==================

If an employee has used all their time off, or is going to run out of time off, they can request an
allocation for additional time. Allocations can be requested in one of two ways, either from the
:ref:`Dashboard <time_off/dashboard>` or the :ref:`My Allocations <time_off/my-allocations>` view.

To create a new allocation request, click either the :guilabel:`New Allocation Request` button on
the main *Time Off* dashboard, or the :guilabel:`New` button in the :guilabel:`My Allocations` list
view. Both buttons open a new allocation request form.

.. note::
   Both :guilabel:`New` buttons open a :guilabel:`New Allocation` request form, but when requested
   from the :guilabel:`Dashboard`, the form appears in a modal. When requested from the
   :guilabel:`My Allocations` list view, the screen navigates to a new allocation request page,
   instead.

Enter the following information on the :guilabel:`New Allocation` request form:

- :guilabel:`Time Off Type`: select the type of time off being requested for the allocation from the
  drop-down menu. After a selection is made, the title updates with the time off type.
- :guilabel:`Validity Period`: this field **only** appears if requesting an allocation with a time
  off type that has the :guilabel:`Take Time Off in` field :ref:`configured
  <time_off/time-off-officer>` to either :guilabel:`Day` or :guilabel:`Half Day`. This field does
  **not** appear if the :guilabel:`Take Time Off in` field is set to :guilabel:`Hours`.

  Using the calendar selector, select a start and end date the allocation is valid for. By default,
  the current date populates the first field, and :guilabel:`No Limit` populates the second field.

  Adjust both of these dates, if desired.
- :guilabel:`Allocation`: enter the amount of time being requested in this field. The format is
  presented in either days or hours, depending on how the time off type is configured. Once this
  field is populated, the name of the allocation request is updated to include the amount of time
  being requested.
- :guilabel:`Add a reason...`: enter a description for the allocation request. This should include
  any details that managers and approvers may need in order to approve the request.

If the request was created from the :guilabel:`Dashboard`, click the :guilabel:`Save & Close` button
to save the information and submit the request.

If the form was completed from the :guilabel:`My Allocations` list view, the information is
automatically saved as it is entered. However, the form can be saved manually at any time by
clicking the *save manually* button, represented by a :guilabel:`(cloud upload)` icon.
